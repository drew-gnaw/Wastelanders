# Welcome to Wastelanders!
Wastelanders is a 2-D turnbased story RPG set in the wastelands... where... 
Carefully manage your moves to counter your opponents and uncover the truth behind the dangerous and alien Waste.

# Gameplay Loop
## Combat
Every round, enemies will declare an attack against characters in the player's party.
In response, each member in a team selects an attack from their attack pool every turn to respond.
After an attack is used, it will go on a cooldown.   
### Card Keywords:
💥Attack: If the attack lands, deal the amount of damage

💫Stagger: If the attack lands before the opponent's attack and the stagger value exceeds the target's attack damage, cancel the target's intended attack. 

🛡️Block: Gains block equal to block value that reduces oncoming damage by consuming an equal amount of block. Block lasts for this turn only but can block damage from several sources.

⚡Speed: Determines what order the attacks are delivered. The higher the value, the faster the attack will come out. (Useful to stagger the enemy before they can attack)

### Character Building (rough sketch)
Depending on the level of the character, they will have X amount of points they can spend on their abilities.

Players will unlock new abilities as they progress through the game, but they can only carry 4 abilities to any fight?

Then you can spend points on adding more copies of cards to your deck that basically determines how many times you can use an ability.

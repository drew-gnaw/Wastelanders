# Welcome to Wastelanders!
Wastelanders is a 2-D turnbased story RPG set in the wastelands... where... 
Carefully manage your moves to counter your opponents and uncover the truth behind the dangerous and alien Waste.

# Gameplay Loop
The gameplay seeks to innovate on traditional turned based RPG's where the players attack, then patiently wait for the enemies to respond. In Wastelanders, you and your enemies will clash together head on based on power and agility to duke it out.

## Combat
Every round, enemies will declare an intention to attack against characters in the player's party.
In response, each member in a team selects an attack from their attack pool every turn to respond.
After an attack is used, it will go on a cooldown or into the discard pile.
When every card from your deck is exhausted, you will be forced to take a round to rest and recover your deck.

Once the player finishes their response, they press the start battle button to commence combat.
The attacks then come out from quickest to slowest, each doing their own thing and possibly staggering the enemy.
### Card Keywords:
üí•Attack: If the attack lands, deal the amount of damage

üí´Stagger: If the attack lands before the opponent's attack and the stagger value exceeds the target's attack damage, cancel the target's intended attack(s). 

üõ°Ô∏èBlock: Gains block equal to block value that reduces oncoming damage by consuming an equal amount of block. Block lasts for this turn only but can block damage from several sources.

‚ö°Speed: Determines what order the attacks are delivered. The higher the value, the faster the attack will come out. (Useful to stagger the enemy before they can attack)

### Combat Notes

Some interesting combat mechanics include having another teammate with a fast attack try to stagger an enemy who is intending to stagger a teammate first, thus the other teammate gets to act.

### Character Building (rough sketch)
Depending on the level of the character, they will have X amount of points they can spend on their abilities.
Each ability will have a cost to add it to your deck, you can opt for a wide variety of small impact cards, or higher impact ones at a higher cost.
This dictates how often your cycle will be, how often you use your abilities, how often you will have to rest and refresh.

Players will unlock new weapons and techniques as they progress through the game.
Weapons dictate what abilities you can bring to your battles. 
For example, if you equipt a pistol and a shortstaff, you can use pistol and shortstaff techniques/abilities in your duel. I.e. Equipting Pistol allows you to fire pistol shots
Each weapon has its pros and cons and this gives you the ability to customize your deck based on the weapons you find and equipt. 
Perhaps these weapons can also bring enchantments and buffs.
